Hi can you learn tacc concepts

Can you read file in this path /eos-trunk/src/SandTunnel/PriorityTagSm.tac

Can you read its corresponding tin file

search for PortEmAccCmdConfig symbol in path /eos-trunk/src/

can you identify all the files/Sm's that are publishing PortEmAccCmdConfig

Can you write a simple tac and tin skeleton,
the tac file should have a counter attribute and a method to increment the counter. Keep it simple

can you improve it by adding a constrainer that reacts to the counter config and publishes a status
